# Hospital-ER-Dashboard-PowerBI
## Project  Objective
This project aims to analyze Hospital Emergency Room (ER) data for 9,200+ patients using Power BI to provide comprehensive operational and patient experience insights. The objective is to track key performance indicators (KPIs) like Avg Wait Time and Patient Satisfaction, identify peak operational demand (Mondays, 7 PM/11 PM), and inform strategic decisions for resource allocation and efficiency across the hospital.

### 📈 ER Performance Analysis: End-to-End Data Project
### 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard

This project analyzes *Hospital Emergency Room (ER)* data for *9,200+ patients* using *Power BI* to drive operational excellence. The primary objective is to track key KPIs like *Avg Wait Time* and *Patient Satisfaction, identify **peak operational demand* (Mondays, 7 PM/11 PM), and inform strategic decisions for *resource allocation and efficiency*.

### 🛠 Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Power BI Desktop* | Used for data modeling, designing interactive visualizations, and creating complex DAX calculations. |
| *Microsoft Excel* | Served as the foundational data source for initial data storage, cleaning, and preliminary structuring. |

## 🌟 Features / Highlights

* *KPI Tracking:* Monitoring of core metrics like *Avg Wait Time (35.3 Min)* and *Patient Satisfaction Score (4.99)*.
* *Peak Demand Analysis:* Identification of the busiest days and hours (*Mondays, 7 PM, and 11 PM*) crucial for staffing optimization.
* *Demographic Segmentation:* Detailed views of patient load segmented by Age, Gender, and Race.
* *Referral Flow:* Tracking patient disposition (Admitted vs. Not Admitted) and analysis of referrals to departments like *General Practice* and *Orthopaedics*.

## 🚨 Problems Addressed

The dashboard provides solutions for critical operational challenges:

* *Long Wait Times:* Pinpointing process bottlenecks contributing to high average wait times, which directly impacts patient experience.
* *Inefficient Staffing:* Providing clear data on peak hours to prevent understaffing during busy times and reduce unnecessary costs during slow periods.
* *Performance Monitoring:* Establishing a clear benchmark for measuring and comparing monthly performance against targets.

## 🚶 Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Views)

The dashboard is structured into four interactive views:

1.  *Consolidated View:* High-level summary of all 19 months (Apr 2023 - Oct 2024), showing overall KPIs and broad demographic trends.
2.  *Monthly View:* Granular, month-specific operational performance analysis.
3.  *Patient Details:* A row-level, searchable table for specific patient record lookup and validation.
4.  *Key Takeaways:* A descriptive analysis summarizing the most important findings and business implications.

## 💡 Impact and Insights

* *Resource Optimization:* Clear identification of peak periods (Mon/7 PM/11 PM) allows managers to schedule staff effectively, improving service efficiency without increasing overall budget.
* *Service Improvement:* Provides empirical evidence to target specific process changes, ultimately aiming to reduce the Avg Wait Time and maintain the high Patient Satisfaction Score.
* *Strategic Planning:* Referral analysis highlights the specialties in highest demand from the ER, aiding long-term hospital resource and capacity planning.
